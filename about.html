        <p>
            SparrOS is an operating system based on the Linux kernel that is designed to be reliable in terms of being a developer PC. Whether your programming experience is C++ and Java or as simple as HTML, SparrOS will offer you the tools to get going with developing software. One of the goals we have had set since we first started on October 27, 2015 is to expand SparrOS to as many platforms as we can.
