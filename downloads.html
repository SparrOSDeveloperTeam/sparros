                SparrOS for Desktop Systems gives you a linux system with developer tools such as various compilers to deploy your own projects with, multiarch compiler support, httpd services, and even emulation. Support for low level and high level languages and be as versatile as possible. For as long as x86 is supported, we will be building for both x86 and x86_64 arch types. SparrOS for Desktop systems is based on the true Linux kernel and hopes to be lightweight as possible. To run SparrOS, you need at least 256MB ram and at least 1.5GHz processing power for good results. SparrOS does not yet have a UI.

                How can I tell the difference between x86 and x64 machines?

            <p>
                Most computers produced since 2009 are more than likely x64. Some BIOSes will tell you if it's a 64-bit machine, or it will list the name of the processor which can be looked up to distinguish the arch type. If you're still unsure whether it's x64 or x86, it's important to note that x86 OSes work on both 32-bit and 64-bit machines while x64 only works on 64-bit machines. We recommend the x64 edition though for optimized purposes.
